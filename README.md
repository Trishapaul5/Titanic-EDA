# Titanic-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
Objective of the Project
To uncover key factors influencing passenger survival, this project aims to perform comprehensive and in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, leaving no stone unturned. Using various data visualization techniques, this analysis aims to:

1. Understand Passenger Demographics â€“ Analyze the distribution of age, gender, and class among the passengers.
2. Identify Survival Trendsâ€“ Determine how class, gender, and fare prices influenced survival chances.
3. Explore Socioeconomic Disparities â€“ Examine how social status was critical in access to lifeboats and safety.
4. Visualize Patterns and Correlations â€“ Use statistical and graphical methods to showcase relationships between variables.
5. Enhance Data Storytellingâ€“ Present the findings in a compelling narrative format that transforms raw data into meaningful insights.

This project aims to provide a statistical understanding of the Titanic disaster. More importantly, it highlights broader societal themes of privilege, vulnerability, and survival dynamics, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the historical event.

General Overview of the Titanic Dataset
The dataset contained information about 891 passengers, with 12 key features, including:
Demographics (Age, Sex, Embarked)
Travel Information (Pclass, Ticket, Fare, Cabin)
Family Relations (SibSp, Parch)
Survival Status (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)
Missing values were found in Age, Embarked, and Cabin, and we handled them by imputing median and mode values. Unnecessary columns like Ticket, Name, and Cabin were dropped.

 Key Insights from Visualizations
(a) Survival Rate
ðŸ”¹ 38.4% of passengers survived, while 61.6% perished (from the pie chart).
ðŸ”¹ This shows that more than half of the people did not survive the Titanic disaster.
________________________________________
(b) Gender and Survival
ðŸ”¹ Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
ðŸ”¹ About 74% of women survived, compared to only 18% of men.
ðŸ”¹ This confirms the historical "Women and Children First" policy during the evacuation.
 Insight: If you were a female passenger, your chances of survival were much higher.
________________________________________
(c) Passenger Class and Survival
ðŸ”¹ 1st-class passengers had the highest survival rate (~63%),
ðŸ”¹ 2nd-class passengers had a moderate survival rate (~48%),
ðŸ”¹ 3rd-class passengers had the lowest survival rate (~25%).
 Insight: Wealthier passengers (1st-class) had better survival chances.
This suggests that social status played a role in evacuation priorities.
________________________________________
(d) Age and Survival
ðŸ”¹ Children (aged <10) had higher survival rates, likely due to the "Women and Children First" rule.
ðŸ”¹ Older passengers (>50) had lower survival rates, possibly because of slower mobility.
ðŸ”¹ Most passengers were aged 20-40 years.
 Insight: Younger passengers were prioritized for survival.
________________________________________
(e) Family Size and Survival
ðŸ”¹ Passengers traveling alone had a lower survival rate.
ðŸ”¹ Those with 1-3 family members had better survival chances.
ðŸ”¹ Large families (â‰¥4 members) had lower survival rates, possibly due to difficulty evacuating together.
 Insight: Being with family improved survival chances, but too large a family could be a disadvantage.
________________________________________
(f) Ticket Fare and Survival
ðŸ”¹ Higher ticket fares were strongly associated with survival.
ðŸ”¹ People who paid more (first-class passengers) were more likely to survive.
 Insight: Paying for a higher-class ticket increased survival chances.
________________________________________
(g) Embarkation Port and Survival
ðŸ”¹ Passengers who boarded from Cherbourg (C) had the highest survival rate (~55%).
ðŸ”¹ Passengers from Southampton (S) had the lowest survival rate (~34%).
 Insight: The embarkation port played a minor role, but wealthier passengers (who had higher survival rates) often boarded from Cherbourg.

(h) Correlation Between Features
ðŸ”¹ Strongest correlation:
Fare and Pclass (-0.55) â†’ First-class passengers paid higher fares.
Survival and Sex (0.54) â†’ Being female increased survival chances.
Survival and Pclass (-0.34) â†’ Higher class increased survival.
 Insight: Gender, class, and fare were the most important survival factors.

Final Conclusion
Who Had the Best Chance of Survival?
Female passengers, especially those in 1st class.
Children (<10 years old).
Passengers who paid higher fares (wealthier individuals).
People who traveled in small family groups (1-3 members).
Who Had the Lowest Chance of Survival?
Male passengers, especially in 3rd class.
Passengers traveling alone.
Older passengers (aged >50).
Passengers who boarded from Southampton.
Final Takeaway 
This code uses the Titanic dataset to tell a compelling story about the factors influencing passenger survival. Through a series of visualizations, it uncovers patterns and insights within the data, transforming raw numbers into a narrative that resonates with the audience, highlighting social dynamics, privilege, and vulnerability aboard the ill-fated ship.
